# Encryption Algorithms that can be used.

[2] Algorithms are implimented here.
- AES 256 (VERY SECURE)
- XOR Encryption (LESS SECURE BUT STILL HARD FOR THE GOVERNMENT)

There is only one dependency. Which can be installed using pip.

```
pip install pycryptodome
```
If for any reason it doesn't work then I have included the tar.gz file in the archive. You need to install it manually.

### Testing Environment
Virtual Machine: Linux kali 6.8.11-arm64 #1 SMP Kali 6.8.11-1kali2 (2024-05-30) aarch64 GNU/Linux

Python Version: Python 3.11.9

#### Encryption Testing:
Created a directory. Inside of it created .txt, .c, a.out, .pdf, .docx files and run the algorithms.
Both of them successfully encrypted and decrypted the files.
